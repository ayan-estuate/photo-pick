# My Photo App

Offline-first React Native (Expo) app scaffold:

- Capture photos using react-native-image-picker
- Store image files locally (expo-file-system)
- Store metadata in SQLite via react-native-sqlite-storage
- Detect network via @react-native-community/netinfo
- Minimal UI with navigation

Notes:

- react-native-sqlite-storage and react-native-image-picker may require native setup.
- If you want a fully managed Expo experience, consider replacing react-native-sqlite-storage with expo-sqlite.
